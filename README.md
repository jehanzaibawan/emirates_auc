## Build instructions
This application is bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Download or clone this repository to your local computer. Once downloaded, open the CMD a.k.a Command Prompt(if using windows), reach to the directory using CD command and run "npm install". This will install all the dependencies I have specified in the package.json file, and are necessary in order to this application work properly.

Once npm install is done, build the project using "npm run build". After the build process is finished, run a static server(if installed) using the command "serve -s build". This will give you the details of the server once after running it.

Open up the browser and enter the URL given by the server, and you will see the application running.
